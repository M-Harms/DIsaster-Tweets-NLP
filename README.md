# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
This is a notebook that uses [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview/description](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview/description). The goal of the notebook is to differentiate whether tweets are about a real disaster. This was done with a recurrent neural network.

## Structure
There is a notebook with all of the data. To run the notebook, you have two choices. One is uncomment out the labled lines in the notebook, and redo all of the training OR copy the files from the output directory, into the same directory, which has the history of all of the training saved.
